Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says the <<S_1>>UK should not 'underestimate its strength'<</S_1>> after Brexit

<<S_2>>Post-Brexit Britain should use its power to defend democracy around the world<</S_2>>, Jeremy Hunt will say today.
The Foreign Secretary will insist the <<S_3>><<S_4>>UK should not 'underestimate' its strength<</S_3>><</S_4>>.
'We are not a superpower and <<S_5>>we do not have an empire<</S_5>>,' he will say in a speech in <<S_6>>Singapore.
<<S_7>>'<<S_8>>But we do have the fifth-biggest economy in the world, the third-biggest overseas aid budget, the second-biggest military budget in Nato, one of the two biggest financial centres, the world's language, highly effective intelligence services and a world-class diplomatic network<</S_6>>.<</S_7>>
'We also have <<S_9>>immense<</S_9>> reserves of soft power, with three of the world's top ten universities, 450,000 international students, 39million visits by tourists in 2017, and a global audience for our media, especially the BBC, measured in the hundreds of millions<</S_8>>.'
Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt will give a speech in Singapore today where he will say the <<S_10>>UK should not underestimate its strength after Brexit<</S_10>>.

Mr Hunt will point to Britain's links with the Commonwealth, the United States and Europe, saying: 'Those connections are why Britain's post-Brexit role should be to act as an invisible chain linking together the democracies of the world ... who share <<S_11>>our values and support our belief in free trade, the rule of law and open societies<</S_11>>.
'We should begin by being realistic about <<S_12>>our global position<</S_12>>.
That means not overestimating <<S_13>>our <<S_14>>strength<</S_14>><</S_13>> but not underestimating it either.'
<<S_15>>Mr Hunt will highlight worrying figures showing that 71 countries saw reversals of political and civil liberties in 2017<</S_15>>.
He will sign a 'strategic partnership' with Singapore covering areas including defence and education.
