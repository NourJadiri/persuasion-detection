Kavanaugh Accuser's Lawyer is Vice Chair of Soros Funded Org Opposing Kavanaugh

Kavanaugh's accuser is being represented by Debra Katz, a Washington D.C. lawyer and the vice chair of the board of the Project On Government Oversight.
POGO co-signed a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Grassley along with a variety of <<S_1>>lefty groups<</S_1>> demanding Kavanaugh records. This was the obstruction tactic of choice of the left for trying to secure the Court seat before they fastened on to this <<S_2>>latest smear<</S_2>>.
Where does PGO gets its funding?
From, among other sources, George Soros and his <<S_3>>Open Society Foundation tentacles<</S_3>>.
And, to no one's surprise, she's allegedly a <<S_4>>Dem donor<</S_4>>.
<<S_5>>What a surprise<</S_5>>! Debra Katz, the lawyer representing the woman accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, has donated thousands of dollars to Obama, Hillary and the DNC! pic.twitter.com/WK5XYTlcqL â€” Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) September 17, 2018
UPDATE: I've received a message from POGO stating that they wish to be described as a <<S_6>>non-partisan watchdog<</S_6>> and that they have a Republican board member.
