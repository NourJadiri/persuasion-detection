Teen Who Had <<S_1>>MAGA<</S_1>> Hat Ripped Off Head Gets New One Signed By Trump

Sixteen-year-old Hunter Richard was wearing a <<S_2>>“Make America Great Again”<</S_2>> hat while enjoying a calm dinner at a Whataburger in Texas when a stranger, now identified as 30-year-old Kino Jimenez, yanked it off his head and threw a soda in his face. But Richard now has a new hat, and it was <<S_3>>signed by Donald Trump himself<</S_3>>!

Jimenez was later arrested and shortly thereafter fired from his job for ripping off Richard’s hat and stealing it. “This is gonna go right in my <<S_5>>f**king<</S_5>> fireplace, <<S_6>>b***h<</S_6>>,” Jimenez said, acting like a <<S_7>>bully<</S_7>> for stealing a teenager’s hat. Jimenez also threw a soda in Richard’s face.
Richard’s hat appeared to be gone for good until the video of the incident went viral and he received a new <<S_8>>MAGA<</S_8>> hat <<S_9>>signed by the president himself<</S_9>>, reported The Daily Wire.
Among those who commented on the video’s original posting was Donald Trump Jr., who retweeted a story about the assault against the teenager. “If someone can get me this young man’s information I’ll get him a new <<S_10>>#maga<</S_10>> hat… SIGNED by #potus!!!” he wrote on Twitter.

Richard told media outlets that he’s been a bit surprised by everything that’s happened since the video was posted online. “I didn’t think it was going to generate the amount like what people are doing, I was looking at the comments by some people and ‘they are like this is uncalled for’ and other people are like mixed opinions but I didn’t think it would blow up to what it is now,” he said to News-4 San Antonio.
