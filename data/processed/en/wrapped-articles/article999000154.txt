Records Support Claims That Minnesota Muslima State Rep Ilhan Omar Married Her Brother

Ilhan Omar has accused Israel of “<<S_1>>evil doings<</S_1>>” in Gaza and called Israel an “apartheid state.” It isn’t surprising that Ilhan Omar would think this way. <<S_2>>She is a hijab-wearing, devout Muslim, and Islamic Jew-hatred is in the Quran<</S_2>>.
What is shameful about this is that her views are mainstream in the Democrat Party today.
She should never have been chosen as a candidate for Congress with <<S_3>>hateful views<</S_3>> of this kind, <<S_4>>but this is the way the Democrat leadership, and the Democrat base, thinks. They want candidates like Ilhan Omar. And they know they’ll win, because this is their base today<</S_4>>.

<<S_5>>Neither the Democrat leadership nor the Democrat base cares that she married her brother.
She is a Muslim and a leftist, so she can further their identity politics.
That’s all that matters to them<</S_5>>.
