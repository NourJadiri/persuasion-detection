Travis Air Force Base terrorist identified as Muslim Hafiz Kazi

Earlier today I wrote: “FBI spokeswoman Gina Swankie and Travis spokesman Airman Christian Conrad declined to elaborate on the matter or identify the driver. Why?”
Now it’s clear why.
They wanted to hold off as long as possible on identifying this terrorist as another Muslim, and this <<S_1>>as <<S_2>>another<</S_1>> jihad terror attack<</S_2>>.
<<S_3>>Protecting the image of Islam, not protecting the public, still seems to be <<S_4>>the most important priority for all too many American officials<</S_4>><</S_3>>.

Officials are treating it as a possible attempted attack. The FBI is now leading the investigation. “The car basically blew up,” said witness Kamren Hernandez. ” <<S_6>>It was nothing anymore<</S_6>>.” Hernandez couldn’t believe what he witnessed from his family’s restaurant just feet from the main gate at Travis Air Force Base — a black SUV exploding seconds after breaching security gates. Hernandez’ father, Lamar, saw it too. “It kept exploding — <<S_7>>boom boom<</S_7>>. Kept on going.” Travis Air Force Base officials are investigating a security incident that occurred at the main gate on Wednesday…. A U.S. official tells ABC News it appears the driver had propane tanks in the vehicle, which they may have ignited deliberately….
