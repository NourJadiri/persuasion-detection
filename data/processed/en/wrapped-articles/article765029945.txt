Stop Comparing Immigration Enforcement to the Holocaust

The media has 2 very simple rules for Holocaust analogies.
1. The Muslim Brotherhood's leaders praising Hitler, calling for another Holocaust and killing Jews is nothing like the Holocaust. And <<S_1>>only <<S_2>>shameless<</S_2>> Zionists would attempt to equate killing Jews with killing Jews<</S_1>>.
2. <<S_3>>Anything a Republican president does is exactly like the Holocaust<</S_3>>.
A former CIA director <<S_4>>compared US immigration policy to Nazi Germany<</S_4>> in an ominous Tweet. “Other governments have separated mothers and children,” Former CIA and NSA chief Michael Hayden wrote on Saturday, along with a black and white photo of the Birkenau concentration and <<S_5>>death-camp<</S_5>> in Poland.
Then Hayden doubled down on that analogy.
It's <<S_6>>particularly stupid<</S_6>> of Michael Hayden to make that analogy because during the Bush years, the agencies he ran were compared to <<S_7>>Nazi<</S_7>> Germany.
Repeatedly.
You might think that would have cured him of facile <<S_8>>Nazi<</S_8>> analogies. But instead it seems to have whetted his appetite for making them.
Yes, the <<S_9>>Nazi<</S_9>> arrested people, asked them for ID, split up families and... then <<S_10>>killed them all<</S_10>>.
That's the really relevant part.
Every country arrests people. Just about every country splits up families when they arrest the parents. That's not unique. Selecting the Jews, based on race, for <<S_11>>extermination<</S_11>> is more of the reason why the term <<S_12>>Nazi<</S_12>> is not a positive one.
Hayden's <<S_13>>thoughtless<</S_13>> tweet can just as easily be used to delegitimize any and all law enforcement. <<S_14>>The attacks here are motivated by a desire for open borders<</S_14>>. Children are being used as <<S_15>>human shields<</S_15>> in a campaign <<S_16>>to end national security<</S_16>> <<S_17>>forever<</S_17>>.
