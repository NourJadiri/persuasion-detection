Homeschooling Protects Children from <<S_1>>Violence<</S_1>> and Marxism

The February <<S_2>>mass shooting<</S_2>> at a high school in Parkland, Florida prompted many parents to consider <<S_3>>homeschooling<</S_3>>. This is hardly surprising, as <<S_4>>the <<S_5>>misnamed<</S_5>> federal “<<S_6>>Gun-Free Schools<</S_6>>” law<</S_4>> leaves schoolchildren <<S_7>>defenseless<</S_7>> against mass shooters. Removing one’s children from government schools seems a rational response to school <<S_8>>shootings<</S_8>>.
School <<S_9>>shootings<</S_9>> are not the only form of <<S_10>>violence<</S_10>> causing more parents to consider <<S_11>>homeschooling<</S_11>>. Many potential <<S_12>>homeschooling<</S_12>> parents are concerned about the failure of school administrators to effectively <<S_13>>protect<</S_13>> children from bullying by other students.
Of course, many parents choose <<S_14>>homeschooling<</S_14>> as a means of <<S_15>>protecting<</S_15>> their children from federal education “reforms” such as Common Core. Other parents are motivated by a desire to <<S_16>>protect<</S_16>> their children from the cultural Marxism that has infiltrated many schools.

The spread of cultural Marxism has contributed to the <<S_17>>dumbing down<</S_17>> of public education. Too many government schools are more concerned with promoting political correctness than ensuring that students receive a good education. Even if cultural Marxism did not <<S_18>>dumb down<</S_18>> education, concerns that government schools are indoctrinating children with beliefs that conflict with parents’ political, social, and even religious beliefs would motivate many families to <<S_19>>homeschool<</S_19>>.
Even when government schools are not intentionally promoting cultural Marxism or other left-wing ideologies, they are still implicitly biased toward big government. For example, how many government schools teach the Austrian economics explanation for the Great Depression — much less question the wisdom of central banking — or critically examine the justifications for America’s hyper-interventionist foreign policy?
Parents interested in providing their children with a quality education emphasizing the ideas of liberty should consider looking into my <<S_20>>homeschooling<</S_20>> curriculum. The Ron Paul Curriculum provides students with a <<S_21>>well-rounded education<</S_21>> that includes rigorous programs in history, mathematics, and the physical and natural sciences. The curriculum also provides instruction in personal finance. Students can develop superior oral and verbal communication skills via intensive writing and public speaking courses. Another feature of <<S_22>>my curriculum<</S_22>> is that it provides students the opportunity to create and run their own internet businesses.
The government and history sections of the curriculum emphasize Austrian economics, libertarian political theory, and the history of liberty. However, unlike government schools, <<S_23>>my curriculum<</S_23>> never puts ideological <<S_24>>indoctrination<</S_24>> ahead of education.
While government schools — and even many private schools — pretend religion played no significant role in history, <<S_25>>my curriculum<</S_25>> addresses the <<S_26>>crucial<</S_26>> role religion played in the development of Western civilization. However, the materials are drafted in such a way that any Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or atheist parent can feel comfortable using the curriculum.
Interactive forums allow students to engage with and learn from each other. The forums ensure students are actively engaged in their education as well as give them an opportunity to interact with their peers outside of a formal setting.
Concern about the safety of students in government-run schools is one reason many parents are considering <<S_27>>homeschooling<</S_27>>, but it is not the only reason. Many parents are motivated by a desire to give their children something better than a curriculum that has been <<S_28>>dumbed down<</S_28>> by federal initiatives like Common Core. Other parents do not wish to have their children <<S_29>>indoctrinated<</S_29>> with views that contradict the parents’ political, social, or even religious beliefs.
I encourage all parents looking at alternatives to government schools —alternatives that provide children with a <<S_30>>well-rounded education<</S_30>> that introduces them to the history and ideas of liberty — to go to RonPaulCurriculum.com for more information about my <<S_31>>homeschooling<</S_31>> program.
