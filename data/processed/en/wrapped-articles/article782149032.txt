<<S_1>>Horrifying Details<</S_1>> Released: 2 <<S_2>>Jihadi Muslims<</S_2>> At <<S_3>>Deadly NM Islamic Compound<</S_3>> <<S_4>>Hit With New Charges<</S_4>>

Siraj Ibn Wahhaj and one of his devout wives were charged with abuse of a child resulting in the death of a child and conspiracy to commit abuse of a child.
Law enforcement <<S_5>>rushed to destroy<</S_5>> the Islamic compound just days after the kidnapping and murder made national news. <<S_6>>They destroyed evidence, despite the fact that the investigation was new and ongoing<</S_6>>. New charges were filed against <<S_7>>the devout (“extremist)” Muslims<</S_7>>. <<S_8>>For years, the FBI and local law enforcement did nothing about this <<S_9>>jihad compound<</S_9>>, despite tips and <<S_10>>numerous calls<</S_10>> from concerned citizens. It took the murder of a child to get them to pay attention. What is the first thing they do after it is discovered a child was murdered on the compound and several starved to almost certain death? <<S_11>>They destroyed the compound to cover up both their negligence and what happened there<</S_11>><</S_8>>.
<<S_12>>News of what happened there was embarrassing to the Muslim community in the U.S., and making Islam look good seems to be the top priority of law enforcement officials<</S_12>>. It’s <<S_13>>sharia compliance<</S_13>> in New Mexico.
