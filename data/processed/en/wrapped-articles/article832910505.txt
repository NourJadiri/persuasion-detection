<<S_1>><<S_9>>The Mueller Circus<</S_9>> is Over, <<S_2>>Long Live the Mueller Circus<</S_2>><</S_1>>

<<S_10>>The Mueller circus<</S_10>> cost the taxpayers millions.
<<S_11>>But it made the media ten times that more<</S_11>>.
The fortunes that the Washington Post and the New York Times made on Mueller leaks and conspiracy theories are <<S_3>>priceless<</S_3>>.
The Mueller report with its <<S_5>>inevitable lies<</S_5>>, smears and assaults from the Obama/Clinton team behind <<S_12>>the grim face<</S_12>> of Robert Mueller is in.
The media won't leave it there.
After running through the entire process of making the report public which, one way or another, it will be, it will fasten on the various state investigations targeting Trump, his family members, his associates and anyone who ever met him since 1989.
These investigations will vie for status.
Some will employ former Mueller coup members.
They will be used by the Democrats running them to fundraise, in violation of all political norms and ethics, bringing us that much closer to <<S_13>>a proper Roman circus<</S_13>>.
The three goals of all this are simple.
1.
Keep the media happy and profitable
2.
<<S_6>>Undermine<</S_6>> President Trump and prevent him from implementing reforms.
3.
Punish the voting public for electing Trump
Never underestimate the power of <<S_16>>the <<S_4>>swamp's spite<</S_4>><</S_16>>.
Much of this is about self-defense.
The more Trump is investigated, the less he can investigate, reform or implement changes to the <<S_7>><<S_8>>swamp<</S_7>><</S_8>>.
But plenty of it is about <<S_14>>malice and spite<</S_14>>.
Culture wars are built on <<S_15>>tribal rage<</S_15>>.
That's what the "resistance" has always been about.
