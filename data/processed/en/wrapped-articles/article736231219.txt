Farrakhan Speech: <<S_1>>'Jews Are My Enemy,'<</S_1>> '<<S_2>>White Folks<</S_2>> Are Going Down'

With the <<S_3>>leftist media<</S_3>> entirely focused on the push to ban AR-15s and repeal the Second Amendment, practically no one noticed Louis Farrakhan's Saviours’ Day 2018 Address in which he told an approving audience that "<<S_4>>powerful Jews are my enemy,"<</S_4>> and "<<S_5>>white folks<</S_5>> are going down," according to The Washington Examiner.
Farrakhan, of course, is the <<S_6>>raging anti-Semite and race-monger<</S_6>> who leads the Nation of Islam, the <<S_7>>loony, militant, black nationalist organization<</S_7>> whose mission is to throw off the yoke of <<S_8>>the inferior white devil<</S_8>>. This is the same Farrakhan with whom then-Sen. Barack Obama took a photo at a 2005 Congressional Black Caucus meeting, <<S_9>>a photo that was subsequently suppressed in order to protect Obama's political future<</S_9>>.
“Jews were responsible for all of this <<S_10>>filth and degenerate behavior<</S_10>> that Hollywood is putting out, turning men into women and women into men,” Farrakhan said in his keynote speech. “<<S_11>>White folks are going down. And Satan is going down<</S_11>>. And Farrakhan, by God’s grace, has pulled a cover off of that <<S_12>>Satanic Jew<</S_12>>, and I’m here to say <<S_13>>your time is up, your world is through."<</S_13>>
After Farrakhan's speech Sunday, CNN anchor Jake Tapper, among a few others, began tweeting out a few quotes from it, and declared that Farrakhan was more dangerous than other "<<S_14>>alt-reich" leaders<</S_14>> because <<S_15>>he “has a much larger following and elected officials meet with him openly.”<</S_15>> His Twitter thread begins here:
Somehow the <<S_16>>openly racist and anti-Semitic Farrakhan<</S_16>> and his <<S_17>>hateful organization<</S_17>> have managed for decades to avoid being <<S_18>>harshly denounced<</S_18>> as such by the news media, <<S_19>>which instead has spent the last two years attempting <<S_20>>to smear Donald Trump as the new Hitler<</S_20>><</S_19>>.
