Dan Fishback: It's Okay to Boycott Israeli Plays, But Not Okay to Boycott BDS Plays

Every time a BDS activist faces a boycott, the #BDStears come out. The latest outbreak of #BDStears comes from Dan Fishback and his supporters.
The American Jewish Historical Society was caught collaborating with JVP; a <<S_1>>radical anti-Israel hate group<</S_1>> with links to anti-Semitism. Here's my article on the subject.
The American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history. These days it’s instead partnering with Jewish Voice for Peace: an <<S_2>>anti-Israel BDS hate group<</S_2>> that defends anti-Semitism and which sponsored talks by an <<S_3>>anti-Semite<</S_3>> who <<S_4>>accused Jews of drinking blood<</S_4>>. Coming up in late October is “The Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?” The two speakers are Robert Herbst, the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP, and Jonathan Kuttab, who advocates a one-state solution for eliminating Israel. He had tweeted, "<<S_5>><<S_6>>EU no longer considers #Hamas a terrorist group. Time for US to do same<</S_6>>."<</S_5>> In December, the AJHS will feature “Rubble Rubble”, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel. Fishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council. His goal is to “normalize Jewish anti-Zionism”. AJHS and JVP members get discounted admission.
The JVP events have been canceled That includes Fishback's Rubble and Rubble. And Dan Fishback is flooding the media with #BDStears. There's an outbreak of them at <<S_7>>anti-Israel<</S_7>> hate sites like the New York Times and the Forward.
"I have grown accustomed to feeling unwelcome in Jewish spaces," Dan Fishback whines. Him, the PLO and the KKK.
"<<S_8>>Any Jew who opposes the Occupation — or opposes Zionism itself — knows that feeling of being shunned from the places that are supposed to shelter and nurture you: families, synagogues, community centers, arts organizations,"<</S_8>> Fishback continues.
"I am <<S_9>>terrified<</S_9>> for the Jewish people. I was raised to believe we were a people of dissent and argument. I was taught that it was important to ask difficult questions, and that it was noble to stand up for what you believed in. <<S_10>>If our Jewish institutions — particularly the American Jewish Historical Society — cannot accommodate dissent, and effectively exclude all Jewish anti-Zionists, then they have not only lost a rapidly growing Jewish population, but they have lost a key aspect of their Jewishness<</S_10>>."
Let's unpack this <<S_11>>knapsack of entitled nonsense<</S_11>>.
Anti-Israel activists like Dan Fishback are entitled to exploit Jewish spaces for their propoaganda... even while they advocate a boycott of the Jews of Israel.
Previously Dan Fishback had authored an article arguing for boycotting some Israeli plays. Now he's <<S_12>>whining<</S_12>> that boycotting his play is a violation of Jewishness because Jews are a "people of dissent and argument." But the only dissent and argument that Jews are supposed to welcome is that of <<S_13>>people who hate the existence of Jewish nationhood. Not of Jewish nationhood itself<</S_13>>.
"it’s not that BDS is “censoring” work — it’s that BDS is resisting a propaganda campaign that was intentionally crafted to influence international politics," Dan Fishback claimed when advocating a boycott of some Israeli plays.
It's not that boycotting Dan Fishback censors work. <<S_14>>It's resistance to a propaganda campaign intended to attack the human rights of the Jewish people<</S_14>>.
It's time for the #BDStears crowd to examine their entitlement and recognize that what's good for the goose is good for the gander. <<S_15>>Either that or they can <<S_16>>go whine to the New York Times some more<</S_16>> because the Jewish community won't let them <<S_17>>burn crosses on their lawn<</S_17>><</S_15>>.
