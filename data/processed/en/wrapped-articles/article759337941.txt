CAPITOL POLICE ACCIDENTALLY GAVE EVIDENCE TO <<S_18>>HOUSE HACKING SUSPECT’S DEFENSE ATTORNEY<</S_18>> By Luke Rosiak on May 24, 2018:
The House IG said Democratic IT aides made unauthorized access to data, but prosecutors haven’t charged them
Democrats appear to want to keep the case out of court; a trial could expose their <<S_19>>reckless IT practices<</S_19>>
<<S_20>>Capitol Police didn’t make arrests despite numerous red flags and then ‘inadvertently’ gave evidence to defense attorneys that was supposed to go to prosecutors<</S_20>>
Prosecutors appear to be sharing info with someone on Capitol Hill who is leaking details to the hacking suspect’s lawyer
The Capitol Police turned over a <<S_21>>trove of evidence<</S_21>> in the alleged Imran Awan House cyberbreach and theft case to the defense attorneys when they were supposed to deliver it to prosecutors instead, according to court documents and a source.
And hours after The Daily Caller News Foundation asked prosecutors about the disclosure, Awan’s lawyer said he had learned of the forthcoming story from a source on Capitol Hill. TheDCNF had not told anyone other than prosecutors about it.
“The cop came to [Awan’s defense attorney] Chris Gowen’s office with a stack of papers … Then he came back and said, ‘I thought you guys were the other party.’ <<S_22>>He was very, very angry<</S_22>>. But Gowen made copies,” the source, who’s familiar with The Awans, told TheDCNF.
Awan, three relatives and a friend ran IT for one in five House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until they were banned on Feb. 2, 2017, for “numerous violations of House security policies.” The violations alleged by the House Office of Inspector General include logging into the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times without authorization. This allegedly occurred during the same period in 2016 the DNC was hacked.
Prosecutor Michael Marando alluded to the disclosure of evidence in court on Oct. 6, 2017.
