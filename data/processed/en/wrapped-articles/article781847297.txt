Trump expresses sympathy for Reality Winner, whose mom asks for pardon

ATLANTA — <<S_1>>The record-setting prison sentence<</S_1>> given to Reality Winner has caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who used it <<S_2>>to take another dig<</S_2>> at Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
In an early Friday post on Twitter, Trump wrote that <<S_3>>her sentence of 63 months in federal prison was unfair and accused Sessions of having a double standard<</S_3>>.
“<<S_4>>Gee, this is ‘small potatoes’ compared to what Hillary Clinton did<</S_4>>!” he tweeted about Winner, a former National Security Agency contractor who leaked a document about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. “<<S_5>>So unfair Jeff, Double Standard<</S_5>>.”
The tweet drew no immediate response from Sessions. But Winner’s mother had a blunt reply: “Please pardon my daughter Reality Winner.”
The Twitter exchange marks <<S_6>>a bizarre twist<</S_6>> in the story of the 26-year-old former U.S. Air Force linguist, who on Thursday apologized to a federal judge and said she takes “full responsibility for my actions.”
Before her arrest, Winner called Trump <<S_7>>an “orange fascist<</S_7>>” on Twitter. Her disillusionment about his election was part of her reason for leaving the Air Force, her mother told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an interview last year.
“Something she said, she didn’t like her new boss,” Billie Winner-Davis said in June 2017. “She was not going to serve in his military.”
Meanwhile, Trump <<S_8>>continued pounding<</S_8>> Sessions in other tweets, saying he needed to investigate “deleted Emails, <<S_9>>Comey lies & leaks<</S_9>>, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr…the Clinton Foundation, illegal surveillance of Trump Campaign, Russian collusion by <<S_10>>Dems<</S_10>> — <<S_11>>and so much more<</S_11>>.”
