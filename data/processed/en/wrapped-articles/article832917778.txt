Reports: No New Indictments Will Come From Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Probe

No new indictments will come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe after he submitted his final report to Attorney General William Barr, multiple outlets are reporting.
A senior Justice Department official told The Washington Post that Mueller “has not recommended any further indictments.” “The investigation is complete,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec told the newspaper.
The Mueller probe saw several within Trump's orbit indicted, but not <<S_1>>Trump’s family<</S_1>> or <<S_2>>Trump<</S_2>> himself.
Some notable figures who have pleaded guilty in charges stemming from Mueller’s investigation are <<S_3>>Trump’s<</S_3>> former personal attorney Michael Cohen, <<S_4>>Trump<</S_4>>’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and former White House National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
