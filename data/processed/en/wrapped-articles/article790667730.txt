Senator Lindsey Graham <<S_1>>Unleashes Firestorm<</S_1>> At Democrat Senators For "<<S_2>><<S_3>>Most Unethical <<S_4>>Sham<</S_4>><</S_3>>" Since He's Been In Politics<</S_2>>

I'm not a fan of Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and he's my senator, but I have to tell you that he was right on point on Thursday when he berated Senate Democrats in their <<S_5>>relentless assault<</S_5>> on Judge Brett Kavanaugh while at the same time <<S_6>>believing every word of Dr. Christine Ford without any evidence<</S_6>>. In fact, all of the evidence and all of the witnesses to date, including Dr. Ford's friend, whom she claims was in the same house that the attack occurred refute her claims. When Graham had his time to speak, he said what many of us thought should have been said.
After Kavanaugh unleashed his own refutation of the charges and <<S_7>>blasted Democrats for their attacks on him<</S_7>>, near the closing of the hearing, Graham finally said what everyone had been waiting on and said it with passion.
"<<S_8>><<S_9>>What you want to do is destroy this guy's life<</S_9>>, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020<</S_8>>," Graham blasted Democrat Senators on the committee.
Sen. Lindsey Graham to committee Democrats: "This is <<S_10>><<S_11>>the most unethical <<S_12>>sham<</S_12>><</S_11>> since I've been in politics<</S_10>>...<<S_13>>Boy, y'all want power. Boy, I hope you never get it<</S_13>>. <<S_14>>I hope the American people can see through this <<S_15>>sham<</S_15>>, that you knew about it and you held it<</S_14>>." pic.twitter.com/NnpcF33smC take our poll - story continues below Who should replace Nikki Haley as our ambassador to the U.N.?

Graham continued, "Would you say you've <<S_16>>been through hell<</S_16>>?"
Kavanaugh responded, "I've been <<S_17>>through hell and then some<</S_17>>."
