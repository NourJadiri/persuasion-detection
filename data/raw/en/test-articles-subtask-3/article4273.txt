Putin’s ally says there is a “100 percent” chance of future wars between Russia and Ukraine

Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and prime minister, said on Wednesday that there would “always” be the possibility of another conflict between his country and Ukraine after the end of the current war.
Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, made the statement in a message posted on his Telegram account.
The longtime close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin is known for making inflammatory statements, often accompanied by threats of nuclear war. Just last week, Medvedev warned that Moscow would hit Ukraine with a nuclear strike if Kiev attacked missile launch sites on Russian territory.
On Wednesday he wrote that “the existence of Ukraine is life-threatening for Ukrainians.”
Medvedev emphasized that he was talking not only about the current political regime in the country, but about “every, absolutely every form of Ukraine.”
“Why? The existence of an independent state on the historic Russian territories will now be a constant pretext for the resumption of hostilities,” Medvedev said. “No matter who is at the forefront of the cancerous growth under the name of Ukraine, this will not give legitimacy to their rule and the legal viability of the ‘country’ itself.”
He continued: “Therefore, the likelihood of a new fight will remain indefinitely. Almost always. “In addition, there is a 100 percent chance of a new conflict, regardless of what security papers the West signs with the puppet regime in Kiev.”
Newsweek emailed Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday seeking comment.
According to Medvedev, this threat of future war would not be averted even if Ukraine joined the European Union or NATO.
“It could happen in 10 years or 50 years,” he said of another possible conflict.
The Kremlin official went on to say that Ukrainians are “at the end of the day a practical people” who will realize that the existence of Ukraine’s statehood is “fatal” for them.
Medvedev said that because of this, “the vast majority of Ukrainians (well, perhaps with the exception of a minimal number of frozen nationalists) will ultimately choose life when choosing between eternal war and inevitable death and life.”
The former president wrote that most Ukrainians would rather live in a larger version of Russia than face eternal war, even if they “wish death for the Russians now” and “hate the Russian leadership.”
“They will understand that life in a large community state, which they no longer like so much, is better than death,” he said. “Her death and the death of her loved ones. And the sooner Ukrainians realize this, the better.”
Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly stated that not only will his country not capitulate to Russia, but that he will not agree to peace negotiations that would allow Russia to retain Ukrainian territory it conquers in the war started by Putin has in February 2022.
