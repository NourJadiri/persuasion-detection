Britt: Don’t let Democrats run from ‘moment before birth’ abortion policy

Ohio voters approved adding certain abortion rights to the state’s constitution Tuesday, causing concern among some conservative Republicans that the party is losing on the issue.
The GOP also lost some important elections in Kentucky and Virginia.
U.S. Sen Katie Britt (R-Montgomery) believes that the Republican Party needs to learn from its mistakes and put out a better message.
Britt discussed the recent elections Thursday on WVNN’s “The Yaffee Program.”
“I think what we have to do is take a step back, take a look at what we’re doing and how we’re doing it,” Britt said. “I think we have to work diligently to change hearts and minds. No good thing is usually easy. Doing a hard thing will be hitting this head on. We must work to protect life and we must work on how we message this.”
The senator thinks her party needs to highlight the radical position of Democrats on abortion.
“We know that the Democrats have an extreme policy and yet we’ve allowed them to control the airwaves and deflect from that,” she argued. “It was last year when every single Democrat voted to be able to take the life of a child the moment before a child was born. And that’s not something that we should allow them to run from. I believe that is not where people in this nation are.”
Britt said many of states’ current abortion policies are among the worse in the world.
“Having abortions after 24 weeks puts the U.S…in a category with only four other nations with regards to that, and one of them is China and one of them is North Korea,” she explained. “And so I certainly don’t want to be in a category with them on this or much of anything.”
She emphasized the need for her party to “do better” when it comes to reaching voters on some of the most important issues the country faces.
“I think we’ve got to just do better,” she said. “We’ve got to be honest about it and figure out how we do a better job of talking on talking to voters. I think we’re right on policy issues. When you look at this nation, whether it is the border, whether it’s abroad, whether it’s here at home, we are weaker on more vulnerable every day that Joe Biden is in the White House. We need to make sure that parents and hard working people know that we’re fighting for them and we also have to fight for the moral compass of this country. I believe that is worth fighting for, I believe that is what we’re called to do, and I think that’s what’s ahead of us.”
