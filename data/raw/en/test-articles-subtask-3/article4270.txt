Sickening Amount Of Americans Left Behind In Gaza

Only a handful of U.S. citizens have been allowed to leave Gaza, according to a State Department representative.
However, hundreds more Americans remain trapped in the region due to Hamas terrorists remaining the main obstacle to their evacuation.
The State Department has been in communication with those stuck in Gaza but has been unable to find a way to get them out.
Efforts are being made with Egypt and Israel to facilitate their departure, but Hamas’ control makes it difficult.
Hamas has been preventing the departure of American citizens and making demands in ongoing negotiations.
Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon told U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken that one particular family “relayed to me how they three times have gotten a text message [or] email saying, ‘Drop everything [and] go to the Rafah crossing,’ and they waited until dark. But each time, nothing happened.”
“They weren’t interfered with by Hamas, just the gate never opened. With the trucks coming in [with humanitarian aid from Egypt], why can’t we at the same time … get those American families … out that gate?” he pressed.
Blinen said there have been “occasions where we thought that we would be able to move forward … only to find that the necessary procedures that had to be put in place to actually make that work couldn’t go forward,” adding that “Hamas has been the impediment to that.” 
“We’re working on it with Egypt. We’re working on it with Israel. We’re looking for ways to get people out. But because Hamas controls what goes on for the most part inside of Gaza, unless it agrees, then it’s going to be very difficult to get that done,” he added.
“It is true the Egyptians are prepared to allow American citizens and foreign nationals to come through the Rafah gate into Egypt. The Israelis have no issue with that,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan stated.
“Hamas has been preventing their departure and making a series of demands. I can’t go through those demands in public, but that is the subject of the discussions in the negotiations that are ongoing,” he added.
