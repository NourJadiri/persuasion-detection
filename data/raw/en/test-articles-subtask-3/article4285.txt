Understanding Hamas vs. Israel

Israel is a terrorist state, and the US media — almost entirely controlled by Jewish interests — constantly omit or minimize coverage of the brutal treatment of non-Jews by Jews in the region. Our view of the conflict should mainly be determined by the fact that Israel is the de facto world headquarters of the war against White people and the closely related war against sexual normalcy. And all of us should publicly be asking the question asked by Ricardo Duchesne today: “Why is the Western ruling class in hysterics over tiny Israel without caring one bit for the far worse disaster unfolding for years now — the genetic/cultural destruction of the European race via mass African/Middle Eastern migration?” Nevertheless, it is still important to understand the origins and dynamics of the generations-long Jewish war against Palestinians.

SOME WHITE AMERICANS are getting agitated by the media over alleged Jewish suffering at the hands of Hamas, and the question always arises: Who owns the land that Israel currently occupies?
I lean more toward the opinion that the Palestinians are in the moral right regarding who really should possess the land that Israel appropriated in 1948. The Jews are forever telling us that the Palestinians did not have a state, since it transitioned rapidly from being a territory of the Ottoman Empire, then a British protectorate, and then. . . Israel. But I don’t see any relevance in that argument. A people need not have organized a state in order to own their land. The reason for organizing a state is to protect your land from being appropriated by force. Unfortunately for them, the Palestinians were never given the time to create guards for their national security. The Jews swooped in too quickly and, with military help from the United States, overwhelmed all Palestinian resistance.
The video above details some of the atrocities which the Palestinians have endured for almost 80 years.
Pragmatically, I again favor the Palestinians. Neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians have ever done much for us Americans. But the Palestinians have harmed us less than the Israelis have. The Lavon Affair. The attack on the USS Liberty. The murder of Rachel Corrie. The stealing of US nuclear technology. And many other such things. Israel has been a real pain. And an expensive one.
Israel has never been an ally of the United States of America. Not truly. Israel is a parasite. The flow of benefit in the relationship between the two countries has always been one-way only. We give them billions of dollars every year, and we get nothing in return, unless you count the contemptuous attitude that the Jews often show us. Israel has stolen our military secrets and has sold them to Communist countries, and they’ve even attacked our armed forces, and our own government hushes up the thefts. Israel’s partisans in the United States control most of the legacy media, which they used for decades to deceive us about the way power works in the world, to prevent alarm at what they are doing to us from spreading. They control our money, and, to an extent, they still control the flow of information. Israel is not our friend. When our politicians say otherwise, they are lying. They lie because the Jews can tar them with bad publicity and can give their rivals decisive amounts of funding during election campaigns.
Understanding the theft of Palestine from its own people is a little complicated, but the biggest difficulty that most people have is the scale of the theft.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the Rothschilds sent their agent, a Jew named Emmanuel Carasso, to Salonica, in Macedonia, with two purposes: (1) overthrow the Turkish sultan and (2) initiate the extermination of the Armenian people. As the first purpose is the one relevant to this answer, I’ll save discussion on the second purpose for another time.
Carasso created an organization that was initially called “The Committee for Union and Progress,” but which soon acquired the popular name “The Young Turks.” Through various devious methods, they succeeded in changing the Turkish government of Sultan Abdul Hamid II in July 1908. Ten years and a world war later, the British acquired control of Palestine.
The British made two contradictory promises: one to the native Palestinians, and the other to the Jews who were immigrating into Palestine and changing the region’s demographics. Which promise would be kept? In the end, the promise made to the Jews was kept. It was called the Balfour Declaration.

The Rise of Hamas Was Encouraged by Israel
Hamas was started by Israel as a way to subvert the political influence of Yassir Arafat and the PLO. Israel lost control of Hamas, and the Jews’ meddling in this regard has come back to bite them.
