The year 2023 has proven that climate change is not coming – it is here and things are spiraling out of control

Politicians often talk about climate change being a problem for future generations to solve, but many scientists say now is the time to act and that the climate has already changed – it is not a distant scenario. Never before has the devastating impact of global warming been more evident than in 2023, the hottest year in human history.
But if this trend continues, 2023 could be one of the coolest years in recent memory. In other words, if we don’t change our relationship with fossil fuels, things will get much worse. In the meantime, we can expect the pile of broken records to continue to grow. Here are some of the key reasons why 2023 became a pivotal year in our anthropogenic downward spiral, but given our ever-changing baselines, it’s probably not an anomaly.

The summer of 2023 was the hottest summer on record.
When United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the world in September that the summer of 2023 had been the hottest summer in history, he did so in unmistakably vivid and dramatic language.
“Our planet has just endured a sweltering season – the hottest summer on record. “The climate breakdown has begun,” Guterres declared, later adding: “The dog days of summer don’t just bark, they bite.”
This year will see “a new global temperature record,” which “underscores the fact that the planet continues to warm as we continue to burn fossil fuels and cause carbon pollution.” In fact, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the June to August 2023 period saw an average global temperature of about 16.77 °C (62.19 °F), an increase of 0.66 °C (33.19 °F). F) compared to the previous year corresponds to normal average.
This extreme heat is not only miserable, it can also be very deadly, essentially triggering mass casualties, exacerbating wildfires, driving up healthcare costs and damaging critical infrastructure, all at a time when the… People have to run at full speed. if they even have it. Additionally, an estimated 90 percent of humanity is expected to suffer even more extreme heat in the coming years.

The world is expected to warm by 1.4°C in 2023
Last month the WMO released another terrible statistic: The The planet’s temperature is expected to rise 1.4º Celsius (2.5º Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. In addition, the organization’s preliminary state of the global climate confirms that 2023 will be the hottest year on record (instead of 2016).
“Greenhouse gas levels are record high. Global temperatures are record breaking. Sea level rise is record-breaking. Sea ice in Antarctica is at record low levels,” WMO Secretary-General Peterri Taalas said while discussing the report.
This figure is particularly worrying because experts believe that if the Earth warms by 1.5 degrees Celsius, a series of irreversible feedback loops will occur, including the collapse of the Gulf Stream current in the Atlantic Ocean and rapid melting from the Arctic and Antarctic to Greenland.

There will be a new global temperature record in 2023
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the average global surface temperature from January to October 2023 was the highest ever recorded in the 174-year history since these readings were taken. Notably, global surface temperature during this period reached a staggering 1.13 °C (2.03 °F) higher than the 1901–2000 average of 14.1 °C (57.4 °F). The previous record, set between January and October 2016, was 0.08 °C (0.14 °F). The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) estimates that there is over 99% chance that 2023 will be the warmest year in history.
In the Northern Hemisphere, the January to October 2023 period was the warmest on record, with a temperature 1.44 °C (2.59 °F) above average. In the Southern Hemisphere, the January-October 2023 period was also the warmest on record, with average temperatures 0.81 °C (1.46 °F) above average.
“I expect these records to be broken on a regular basis due to ongoing climate change. But I didn’t expect them to be broken in such large quantities.”

The heat content of the oceans will also set a new record
When the salon contacted Dr. Addressing Dr. Michael E. Mann, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, he listed among the most important climate change news in 2023 that this year “will see a new global surface temperature record.” which “underscores the fact that the planet continues to warm as we continue to burn fossil fuels and create carbon pollution.”
Mann also pointed to another worrying development – namely the “heat content of the oceans, which is also set to set a new record.” He argued that this is “of equal importance because warming oceans are helping to destabilize ice shelves and fuel more powerful hurricanes and tropical cyclones.”
Actually, loudly NOAAOctober 2023 was the seventh consecutive month of record high monthly global sea surface temperatures. Already in August NASA announced that “the ocean has a fever,” with NASA oceanographer Josh Willis explaining that the two main factors behind the record highs are “an El Niño forming in the Pacific, on top of long-term global warming.” This caused ocean temperatures to nearly rise everywhere steadily for a century.”

The melting ice also suffered major damage
According to WMO, Antarctic sea ice extent reached an all-time low in 2023, at least in terms of what scientists have known since the beginning of the satellite age in 1979. From June onwards, the sea ice extent reached a record low and the annual maximum in September 2023, the total area was 16.96 million km2, around 1.5 million km2 below the average from 1991 to 2020. The authors drew particular attention to Switzerland, where “the “Glaciers have lost around 10% of their remaining volume in the last two years.” Glaciers in North America and elsewhere in the European Alps were hit.
“The global sea ice minimum observed earlier this year underscores the larger trend toward melting ice, warming polar regions, and destabilizing ice sheets,” Mann wrote to Salon.

Bottom line: 2023 is on track to be the hottest year on record
As the WMO announced at COP28, the United Nations climate summit in Dubai, 2023 is “almost certain” to be the hottest year on record once December 31 passes. As Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the WMO, explained in Dubai: “It is a deafening cacophony of broken records.”
The experts who spoke to Salon agree with this assessment.
“The record monthly global mean temperature records this summer are unusual,” Michael Wehner, senior scientist in the Computational Research Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, told Salon by email. “I expect these records to be broken on a regular basis due to ongoing climate change. But I didn’t expect them to be broken in such large quantities. So that’s scientifically interesting.”
Wehner added: “Still, I am more concerned about the regular but increasing record-breaking global average temperatures we have seen over the last two decades or so. This shows that we have not slowed down climate change.”
Mann repeated this observation.
“The record temperatures of 2023 highlight how ongoing human-caused warming will continue to be accompanied by natural climate fluctuations – in this case [weather patterns like] El Niño – to exceed ever new thresholds, including increasingly prolonged periods when global surface temperatures exceed 1.5°C and brief moments when we even exceed 2°C,” Mann told Salon. “It is a warning that if we fail to dramatically reduce carbon emissions in the coming years, we will consistently exceed these thresholds in a decade or two.”
