Hamas releases video of Israeli hostage's message to Netanyahu: We're suffering because of your failure

Hamas's Al-Qassam Brigades published a video footage Monday of three Israeli women hostages sending a message to the Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
One of the female Israeli hostages said in the video: "Benjamin Netanyahu, Hello, we have been prisoners of Hamas for 23 days... Yesterday there was a press conference for the families of the prisoners, and we know that there was supposed to be a ceasefire, and you were supposed to release us, and you promised to release us. However, we are suffering from your political, security and military failure, because of the failure you caused on the 7th of October, because there was no soldier in the place and no one came to us, and no one defended us, and we are innocent and naive citizens; citizens who pay taxes to the State of Israel. We are now in captivity under "no conditions." You are killing us, do you want to kill us all? You want the army to kill us? Isn't it enough that you slaughtered everyone? isn't it enough for you that there were Israeli citizens killed? Release us now, release their [Palestinians hostages] citizens and hostages now. Release us! Release everyone! We deserve to go back to our families, now now now (She screams loudly)."
The war on Gaza has entered its 23rd day since the start of Operation “Al-Aqsa Flood” on October 7, as Israeli forces continue to bomb various parts of the Gaza Strip from land, sea and air, resulting in thousands of Palestinian deaths and injuries. The number of Palestinian citizens killed thus far was announced Monday to reach 8,306.
