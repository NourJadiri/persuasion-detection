DeSantis’ anti-vax surgeon, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, calls COVID vaccinations “the Antichrist”

The recent diatribe from Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo’s anti-COVID-19 vaccine take on a religious note Thursday when he told far-right podcast host Steve Bannon that the shots are the “Antichrist of all products.”
A day after Ron DeSantis’ appointee called for an end to mRNA vaccines because he believed they could harm DNA — a claim experts have refuted — Ladapo repeated his baseless claims to Bannon.
“I think there is probably some integration into the human genome at some levels,” Ladapo said on the website War room Podcast, “because frankly these vaccines are the antichrist of all products.” So I think that’s probably the case. But I’m not saying it is.”
“I’m saying that they themselves said that this should be tested for,” he said of the Food and Drug Administration. “And that didn’t happen, and they didn’t provide any evidence that it happened. And that is so wrong. You know, it’s just a complete disrespect for the human genome and the importance of protecting and preserving it. And that is our connection to God.”
Ladapo’s mix of vaccine skepticism and religious implications and the like was created at the beginning of 2021 amid America’s nationwide vaccination effort, has been condemned by the FDA.
“It is misleading to repeatedly reference information about residual DNA in COVID-19 vaccines without placing it in the context of the manufacturing process and the known benefits of the vaccine,” said FDA spokeswoman Cherie Duvall-Jones said in a statement this week.
Many right-wing extremist influencers and experts have mixed Christian and anti-vaccination messages in recent years. The idea that COVID-19 vaccines could contain the “mark of the beast” — a reference to a prophecy in the Book of Revelation that says the Antichrist will mark unclean Christians to exclude them from heaven — is there Purchase won in many conservative Christian circles.
Ladapo’s other dubious activities reportedly include altering the results of a study to suit his anti-vaccination stances, recommending that healthy children not be vaccinated and claiming that masks have not saved lives.
