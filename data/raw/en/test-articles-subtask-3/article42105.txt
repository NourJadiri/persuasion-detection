Putin accuses 'neo-Nazis in Ukraine' of committing crimes against civilians

Vladimir Putin on Friday accused "neo-Nazis in Ukraine" of committing crimes against civilians, on the occasion of the international day of victims of the Holocaust, a rhetoric that the Russian president regularly uses to justify his military offensive.
“Forgetting the lessons of history leads to the repetition of terrible tragedies. The proof of this is the crimes against civilians, the ethnic cleansing (and) the punitive actions organized by neo -Nazis in Ukraine,” Vladimir Putin denounced in a press release.
"It is against this evil that our soldiers are fighting courageously" in Ukraine, he added.
