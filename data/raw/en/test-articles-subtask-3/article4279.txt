Climate change is being exploited by “mega billionaires” to tyrannize the planet, warns RFK Jr.

In an interview this week with Kim Iverson, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reiterated his free market-based approach to environmentalism, warning that the typical communist Democrat position on climate change is much different.
Instead of embracing a top-down totalitarian approach that benefits "mega-billionaires," Kennedy says he supports a free market, capitalism-based approach to environmental protection.
"Climate issues and pollution issues are being exploited by, you know, the World Economic Forum and Bill Gates and all of these big, you know, mega billionaires," Kennedy stated.
"The same way that COVID was exploited to use it as an excuse to clamp down top-down totalitarian controls on society and then to give us engineering solutions."
Kennedy would go on to reveal that these same exploitative mega-billionaires are all embedded within the environmental regulatory agencies that are imposing climate tyranny on the masses.
"And if you look closely, as it turns out, the guys who are promoting those engineering solutions are the people who own the IPS, the patents for those solutions," he said.
"It's a way they've given climate chaos a bad name because people now see that it's just another crisis that's being used to strip by the wealth of the poor and to enrich billionaires."

RFK Jr.'s positions are widely popular among Americans from both sides of the political aisle
For the past 40 years, Kennedy has maintained the same positions on policies related to climate and engineering. His speeches going back to the 1980s show that he has always supported "free market capitalism" as the solution to environmental problems.
With an agenda like this, Kennedy might as well be running as a Republican. In many ways, though, it is better that he is running as a Democrat because Kennedy's positions used to be more the norm among Democrats, who have since been co-opted by far-left extremism.
Because Kennedy's positions make sense, though, and are likely to be widely supported by Americans of all political stripes, the establishment will probably keep him hidden away and out of view as much and for as long as possible, just like they did to Ron Paul and others in the past who rocked the boat politically speaking.
"RFK Jr. is correct in saying that they want to use climate change as a way to usher in totalitarian control," one commenter wrote.
"It's never been about 'saving the planet' and it's not about clean air or water," responded another. "It IS a scam to keep people from having a better life."
"The eco-fascists will force you into a tiny clown car, a 200 sq. ft. tiny home for your family, a 900-calorie daily diet, a government-controlled thermostat and only one child per family and travel by ox cart. The eco-elite will not have any of these restrictions. They will live the lifestyles of the rich and famous with luxury yachts, stretch limos and Lear jets, multiple 10,000 sq. ft. mansions on huge 1,000-acre estates. They will manufacture ANY crises to push their agenda. 'We can run the WORLD and your LIFE better than you. So do as we say not as we do.'"
Another wrote that the leftist lie about promoting a "common good" also feeds into the elites' agenda as they laugh their way to the back at the expense of our collective freedom and liberty.
