Ben Carson: Rape Victims Who Have Abortions Are Just Like Slave Owners

Ben Carson may speak in a soft and nonthreatening manner, but that doesn’t mean his ideas aren’t any less dangerous. Like all the other Republican candidates for president, he has adopted Donald Trump’s enthusiasm for fabricating facts and making outrageously offensive statements.
Having recently drawn a firestorm of criticism for disrespecting the families of gun violence victims, insinuating that European Jews were complicit in the Holocaust by not arming themselves sufficiently, and declaring that he would cut off funding for overly liberal universities, one would think he might consider showing a little tact with his statements. Not Carson, though, who decided a Sunday interview with Chuck Todd was a good time to announce that he wanted to overturn Roe V. Wade, deny abortions to rape victims, and compare a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body to the centuries of slavery endured by African-Americans.
“The mother should not believe that the baby is her enemy and should not be looking to terminate the baby. We’ve allowed purveyors of division to think that baby is their enemy and they have a right to kill it. Can you see how perverted that line of thinking is?”
“Think about this. During slavery — and I know that one of those words you’re not supposed to say — but I’m saying it. During slavery, a lot of the slave owners thought they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave, anything that they chose to do. And what if the abolitionists had said, ‘You know, I don’t believe in slavery, I think it’s wrong. But you guys do whatever you want to do.’ Where would we be?”
“Rape or incest, I would not be for killing a baby because the baby came about in that way,” he explained. “And all you have to do is go and look up the many stories of people who have led very useful lives who are the result of rape or incest.”
What’s truly perverted is Ben Carson’s thought process. The draconian system of religious morality he wants to impose on our nation and his desire to deprive American women of agency over their own bodies is the better subject for a slavery metaphor.
This man claims to be a doctor, but shows no concern for the health or mental well-being of American women. He claims to be a man of science, but questions where gravity comes from and denies the reality of climate change. He has no policy proposals, political experience, or coherent message other than extremist Christian fundamentalism. We absolutely cannot allow this man anywhere near the White House.
