Hamas apologists are facing consequences

“We are fighting to save the whole world from the pestilence of Nazi tyranny and in defense of all that is most sacred to man,” Winston Churchill once declared.
Today’s Nazis, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared Wednesday, are Hamas — the barbarous terrorist group that has brutally slaughtered, kidnapped and raped nearly 1,600 innocent Israelis.
Last weekend, Aurora City Council members Juan Marcano and Alison Coombs canceled their memberships in Denver’s chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) in opposition to the organization’s brazen defense of Hamas’ brutal acts of terrorism and war crimes. Was it genuine?
On Tuesday, I explained how DSA resignations were driven by political convenience during an election year — with Marcano running for mayor and Coombs seeking City Council at-large — given Denver DSA’s longstanding anti-Semitic views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For instance, back in 2017, they’d shared the phrase “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” — which implies replacing Israel with a Palestinian state.
At Monday’s city council meeting, Marcano and Coombs confirmed these suspicions. When Councilwoman Francoise Bergan proposed a resolution heartily backing Israel and unequivocally condemning Hamas and anti-Semitism, Marcano and Coombs offered amendments to fundamentally change its intent — by trying to equate Israel with Hamas.
Earlier that day, Coombs touted the Working Families Party, a radical alternative to DSA that tends to endorse identical candidates. “I stand with WFP in their push to save the lives of Palestinians in the face of Israeli war crimes and apartheid,” she tweeted.
Let’s be real: Neither Marcano nor Coombs were being genuine — and they were clearly playing politics when they canceled their DSA memberships. Now, their politics have begun alienating loyal Democrats.
Littleton Democrat Jane Ringer is a retired accountant who, until recently, served as the Arapahoe Democratic Party’s volunteer treasurer. A donor to candidates across the county, she’d originally assumed her views would largely align with both Marcano and Coombs and donated a total of $125 between the two.
This week, Ringer asked both Marcano and Coombs to send her money back. “As a Jew whose father fought in World War II, I find their positions to be appalling. I thought we already fought this battle, you know?” she told me. “I have zero tolerance for the obliteration of Israel. So, I’m voting with my wallet by asking for my money back.”
“I am now in alignment with my values, and I feel much better having spoken up,” Ringer added. “This just cuts way too deep for me.”
When a candidate you support abandons your core values, you can always “claw back” any donations. If enough join in, it could deplete campaign war chests.
“There’s still three weeks left until election day, and people should know they can vote not just with their ballot but with their money,” Ringer said. “If you have already donated, and you’ve suddenly discovered that a candidate is way out of alignment with your values, you can request a refund of your donation and explain to them why you’re doing it.”
A growing number of wealthy donors are similarly voting with their wallets at a much larger scale — objecting to the shocking failures of Ivy League universities to decisively condemn anti-Semitism and show support for Israel in its battle against Hamas.
The Huntsman Foundation, which has contributed tens of millions of dollars to the University of Pennsylvania, decided to “close its checkbook on all future giving” due to the university’s “silence in the face of reprehensible and historic Hamas evil against the people of Israel (when the only response should be outright condemnation).”
Other notable billionaire donors like Ronald Lauder, Marc Rowan and David Magerman likewise threatened to cut their contributions to Penn.
Harvard University also faces staggering donor dissatisfaction. Former Limited Brands CEO Les Wexner’s Wexner Foundation cut off funding after three decades over “the dismal failure of Harvard’s leadership to take a clear and unequivocal stand” against Hamas. Other wealthy donors and alumni publicly blasted Harvard’s shocking tolerance of anti-Semitism.
The presidents of both Harvard and Penn finally issued strongly-worded statements condemning Hamas and rejecting anti-Semitism — but it’s likely too little, too late.
For different reasons, as Newsweek reported Wednesday, at least 10 former donors to embattled Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert — who collectively contributed nearly $13,000 to her 2020 campaign — have instead donated $17,800 total to her opponent in the Republican primary, lawyer Jeff Hurd.
Hurd announced his campaign this August but already reportedly raised nearly half of Boebert’s $854,000 in the bank — which is itself only a third of the whopping $3 million that her Democratic challenger, Adam Frisch, raised from July to September.
If Boebert wins her primary, as remains likely, can she raise enough to compete with Frisch? When I was in Mesa County last weekend, Boebert supporters expressed concern that her numerous rhetorical excesses and personal faults might doom her campaign in what should be a breeze reelection for a Republican.
Reality is starting to intervene in our heated sociopolitical climate. People are finally reaching their limits — drawing lines and making their voices heard through their wallets.
The actions of our leaders and institutions have consequences.
