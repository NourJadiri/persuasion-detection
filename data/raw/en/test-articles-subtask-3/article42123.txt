2023: The Year Climate Alarmists Got *Everything* Wrong

2023 was a crazy, crazy year; a year where #ClimateAlarmists literally lost all touch with reality and started saying things that were complete fabrications. They just outright made up charts and graphs, manipulated data, and lied to our faces — all in the service of the #ClimateScam and the Davos elite.
It felt we were living in upside down world.
Global warming, my ass. The elites are just trying to fool you so that there are more resources for them. Remember, the billionaires at Davos want you to eat bugs! You’re an idiot if you fall for it.
To #ClimateCrisis cultists, up is down, cold is hot, blue is red, and the present is the past. It’s literally insane!
As Time Magazine predicted all the way back in 1977, the real data show that the world is actually cooling, and we are rapidly headed into a new ice age. Hear anything about that these days in the woke mainstream media? No, of course not. The media are shills for the billionaire elites and the #ClimateHoax.
So let’s take a few minutes to go over the real facts of the “climate crisis” in 2023.

“The Ice Caps are Melting”
Bullshit. Temperatures at the poles have been diving over the past four decades.

You can look at either pole and the story is the same; we’re in a period of dramatic cool down.

“Sea Ice is Shrinking”
More lies! Global sea ice is at its greatest extent since at least the late 1970's.

Even if you’re looking just at the Antarctic, sea ice extent has been at record levels most of the year.

“The Glaciers are Retreating”
More climate scammer BS.

Past and present photos prove that glaciers are surging, not retreating. Increased snowfall has caused glaciers to expand around the world!

“Sea Surface Temperatures Were at Record Highs”
You mean record lows, right climate alarmist scum?
Sea surface temperatures dove to record lows in March and have stayed there ever since.

It doesn’t matter which ocean you look at, they’re all the same: record low temperatures all year.
In fact, sea surface temperatures have been falling for over 100 years.
What we should be worried about is not fake heat, but how these record cold temperatures are affecting vital fisheries.

“Sea Levels are Rising”
This one is just too crazy to believe! The climate hoaxers are asking us to deny the evidence of our very own eyes!
[Line chart showing the mean sea level value across the years, source cited]
The fact is that the rapid cooling of the planet has caused sea level to drop as glaciers expand.
What we should be worried about are impacts that sea level drop will have on tourism, not fake beach erosion and imaginary flooding.

“It’s Getting Hotter”
By now it should be pretty obvious that if the poles are colder, glaciers and sea ice are expanding, sea levels are dropping, and sea temperatures are dropping… that it’s not getting hotter.
This is the biggest climate scam of all.
Walk outside. I dare you. Is it hot or cold? It’s cold, right?
That’s because it’s called winter, and winter is cold. Duh. Climate scammers think we’re all idiots!
But the truth is that it’s the climate hoaxers who are idiots.
[Infographics showing montly and yearly air temperature anomalies]
Even the Japanese know it’s a scam! It’s been getting colder every year since at least 1890!
They’re even trying to tell us that 2023 was the hottest year on record, when the truth is that 2023 was the coldest year in the past 125,000 years!
And what about those vaunted “global warming stripes”?? Fake, of course.
Instead of worrying about how “global warming” is going to impact the tropics, we should worry about global cooling will hurt tropical rainforests.

How to Stop the Lies
One of the best ways to avoid falling for the endless lies of the climate scammers is to follow some truly impartial climate experts on X. Lord Elon has made sure that X is a bastion of truth and free speech, and these folks are worth a follow! [List of names]
Don’t let upside down world win. Fight back with the truth.

Denouement
If you haven’t figured it out by now, all the data in these graphs — while taken from and linked to the original source — has been inverted. Thus, “upside down world.”
This story was inspired (if that’s the word) by a Tweet from Zack Labe showing how some climate denier troll had basically just inverted his graph and posted it as fact.
I realized that (having been a professional photographer for nearly 20 years), I had way better Photoshop skills than that guy.
Also, having spent a week dancing with the trolls, I felt inspired to do the laziest climate troll imitation that I could — not even bothering to make up data, just inverting a bunch of graphs in Photoshop and swapping out before and after photos.
I sincerely hope that no one is mad at me for putting their data in “upside down world”. Zack, I know I picked on you a lot, but you have some of the best climate graphics out there!

A Final Word
I honestly think that if what is satirically portrayed in this story were actually happening (i.e., we were entering an ice age at this insanely rapid rate), the entire world would be frantically trying to do something about it.
But the fossil fuel companies have done their work so well that a large part of the populus — and most of the rich and powerful — refuse to even listen.
They are the ones living in upside down world.
