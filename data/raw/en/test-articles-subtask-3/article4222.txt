KCNA Commentary on Middle East Situation

The situation in the Middle East is getting worse to approach the threshold of a total war.
In Israel, an order was issued to prepare for all-round invasion and air raids on the Gaza Strip are expanding.
The Israeli military warmongers are openly crying out that "they would soon see the Palestine territory."
It is the unanimous voice of the international community that the Middle East situation, which poses the danger of an all-out war, is a tragedy entirely caused by the U.S.
At the outbreak of the situation, the U.S. immediately committed itself to supporting Israel with aid and weapons and dispatched aircraft carriers Gerald R. Ford and Dwight D. Eisenhower to the dispute waters.
The U.S. political and military bosses including the secretary of State, the secretary of Defense and even the U.S. president flew to Israel to encourage the war, saying that "as long as the U.S. exists, Israel is not alone" and "security support will continue."
On Oct. 18, the U.S. vetoed a UNSC resolution aimed at ensuring ceasefire and defusing humanitarian crisis and thus obliterated even the slight opportunity of preventing the deterioration of the Middle East situation.
This time, too, the EU, a devoted observer without any independent thinking and principle, is joining the U.S.
The large-scale massacre in the Middle East is escalating due to the prejudiced and intentional instigation of the U.S.
On Oct. 19, Biden claimed it was very important for the U.S. national security that Israel and Ukraine succeed in the wars, and requested Congress to spend $106 billion in urgent expenditure, including support for local servants.
The U.S. has persistently patronized Israel, which illegally occupied Palestinian territory and is getting engrossed in ceaseless armed attacks, inhuman killing of civilians and expansion of the Jewish settlements, for its domestic politics and strategy for world supremacy. This has resulted in the failure to realize the Palestinian peopleâ€™s desire to build an independent state and the sustained historical inequity they are facing.
The U.S. is blaming the Middle East crisis onto Palestine while branding it an "aggressor", but the fair international community is categorically rejecting this.
Foreign ministers of the Arab League member states held an emergency meeting in Cairo on Oct. 11, at which they strongly urged Israel to return to the negotiations for the "two-state plan" to provide a state where the Palestinian people can live, contending that peace in the Middle East would be impossible without an independent Palestinian state.
World public warns that the stability and security on the earth are being threatened due to the arbitrary and double-standard foreign policy of the U.S.
The international community should closely watch the U.S. moves and resolutely denounce and reject the dangerous and foolish attempt.
