The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) condemned Britain's intention to fly surveillance planes over Gaza, considering it a direct participation in the Israeli "genocide" war against the Gaza Strip and the massacres committed in it.
Hamas said in a statement on Telegram on Sunday that "Britain's disclosure of its army's intention to carry out intelligence sorties over the Gaza Strip makes it a partner with the Zionist occupation in its crimes, and responsible for the massacres to which the Palestinian people are exposed."
"London should have corrected its historical offensive stance against the Palestinian people, and atonement for the Balfour Declaration (1917), which is the sin of the century, instead of committing another sin and reminding the world of its shameful colonial past," the statement said.
The British Ministry of Defense announced last Saturday that it would conduct reconnaissance flights over the eastern Mediterranean, including airspace over Israel and the Gaza Strip, with the aim of providing intelligence to Tel Aviv under the pretext of supporting "the operation to rescue detainees."
The ministry said in a statement on Saturday that London has been working with its partners in the region since the seventh of last October to ensure the release of detainees, including British citizens, and noted that the safety of its citizens is Britain's top priority.
Hamas said in its statement that Britain's intention to conduct "reconnaissance flights" over the Gaza Strip puts the British government itself in enmity with the Palestinian people and all the free people of the world who reject the Israeli aggression on Gaza.
The movement called on Britain to withdraw what it described as its direct participation and political and financial support for the war of extermination against Gaza, and to stop its dependence on the United States of America as well as its contribution to igniting wars, instead of contributing to peace and stability in the region.
Since the seventh of last October, the Israeli army has launched a continuous aggression on Gaza, leaving 15,523 martyrs, 41,316 wounded, in addition to massive destruction in residential neighborhoods, vital facilities and hospitals.
On November 24, Hamas and Israel entered into a seven-day truce brokered by Qatar in coordination with Egypt and the United States, during which 7 Israelis who were detained in Gaza were released, compared to 80 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons, before the occupation continued its aggression on the Strip.
