Marjorie Taylor Greene Responds To Trump Charges By Calling COVID-19 A Biological Weapon

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) is continuing her defense of former President Donald Trump, even after his third criminal case emerged this week that this time relates to attempts by him and his allies after the last presidential election to secure him another four years despite his documented loss to Joe Biden.
On Wednesday morning, she posted a lengthy statement to Twitter complaining about the new charges Trump is facing, which include allegations of conspiracy to defraud the United States. In the course of her commentary, she touched on what she called “bird killing wind turbines” and referred to COVID-19 as a “man made biological weapon,” which is not the consensus view from established authorities, though some have explored the possibility of a lab leak — which experts have noted would not necessarily mean the spread of the virus was intentional.
Greene’s overall argument was that Americans are facing much more serious issues than those ostensibly represented by the case newly brought against Trump by Special Counsel Jack Smith at the federal Justice Department. A key component of arguments she and others ideologically aligned with her have pushed to further this idea is the contention that the southern border is “open,” which isn’t reflected in the facts. Government personnel directly involved in the handling of the border have disputed this characterization, though proposed articles of impeachment against Biden from Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) even claimed — in something totally out of touch with what’s actually being seen — that foreign criminal organizations have taken operational control of the southern border.
Greene said, in part: “Yeah while they ALL supported violent BLM riots that destroyed $2 billion in private property in communities across America that killed people and attacked police day and night, while they violated your rights locking down our country over a man made biological weapon that was like the flu for most of the healthy population especially children, forced you to take an experimental vaccine that killed people with strokes, blood clots, myocarditis, and has left people with serious health issues, and are forcing our country and Americans pay for it all switching us to unreliable electric cars run by Chinese made toxic batteries, Chinese made bird killing wind turbines, and stop using reliable U.S. oil, gas, and clean coal bc the climate gods said we must achieve the unachievable net zero carbon – which will make electricity scarce and unaffordable for most Americans plunging us literally into darkness.”
Democrats consistently distanced themselves from the isolated instances of violence to which Greene refers, and she has also misrepresented the nature of data linking deaths to COVID-19 vaccines. In truth, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting Systems (VAERS) provides for the broad collection of data on potentially adverse events recorded soon after a vaccine’s administration without regard to whether a meaningful connection was actually established. That comes later, and the early data to which Greene has pointed is inherently inconclusive.
